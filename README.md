Fluent is the first Swift ORM that works with both SQL and NoSQL. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use syntax for interacting with your database.

This repository is the framework's source code. To view a sample project, check out the [Fluent Example](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-example).

Clone the [Example](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-example) project to start making your application. If you are also looking for a web server, check out [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor). It was built to work well with Fluent.

You must have Swift 3 or later installed. You can learn more about Swift 3 at [Swift.org](http://swift.org)
